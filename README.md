# CostumeQuest-Decomp
This is a decomp of the Steam release of [Costume Quest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/115100/Costume_Quest/). Progress is likely to be really slow, as I know nothing about decomps.

## Key Notes
- The compiler used is MSVC 9.X (Visual C++ 2008) because the binary imports ``MSVCP90.DLL`` and ``MSVCR90.DLL``.
- The Steamworks SDK used here is V1.16 from 29th July 2011, a few months before the game's release. The exact version used in the game is unknown.

# Known Dependencies
- Steamworks SDK V1.16
