# CostumeQuest-Decomp
This is a decomp of the Steam release of [Costume Quest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/115100/Costume_Quest/). Progress is likely to be really slow, as I know nothing about decomps.

## Key Notes
- The compiler used is MSVC 9.X (Visual C++ 2008) because the binary imports ``MSVCP90.DLL`` and ``MSVCR90.DLL``.
- The Steamworks SDK is used in this game, but ommited from the decomp.
- Even when this decomp is complete you still need various other games files to run the game.
